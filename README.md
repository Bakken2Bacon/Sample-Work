# Sample-Work


This contains some of my coding samples. The Weather Scraper was completed late 2017. It goes to the Des Moines weather website, finds the temperature(s), and uploads it into a local DB.

Some of the other work is from exercises I found online, and was used to learn/improve my Python skills.

Data Science Related: 
I have uploaded some of my documents from taking online courses on Data Science also. Most of these I programmed as I went through the exercises. This is intended to demonstrate my knowledge of numpy, pandas, seaborn, etc. I have also meddled around with scikit learn and it's various intricacies.
